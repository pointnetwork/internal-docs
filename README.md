Slack is good, but threads get buried and pinning stuff gets cumbersome. so, I
propose the following workflow when discussing stuff:
* We start a discussion on Slack. if it's not leading anywhere meaningful, we
  stop and we call it a day. if it's worth archiving it:
* We move the description of the problem to be discussed to a Github Issue,
  along with some of the pre-discussions that we had on Slack
* We continue on point-discussions

Why private? Because there might be stuff that the public should not know. Like
when we were discussing the legalities of having a Point Store. And they're not
going to be mature enough ideas to reach PIP-level.

When an idea reaches maturity, we can then escalate the discussed matters into a
proper PIP.
