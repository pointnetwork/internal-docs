Slack is good, but threads get buried and pinning stuff gets cumbersome. so, I
propose the following workflow when discussing stuff:
* We start a discussion on Slack. if it's not leading anywhere meaningful, we
  stop and we call it a day. if it's worth archiving it:
* We move the description of the problem to be discussed to a Github Issue,
  along with some of the pre-discussions that we had on Slack
* We continue on point-discussions

When an idea reaches maturity, we can then escalate the discussed matters into a
proper PIP.
